/**
 * 134. Gas Station

 * There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].
 *
 * You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 *
 * Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
 * Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
 * Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
 * Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
 * Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
 * Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
 * Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
